Hi there, I'm Khalid Ahmed
I made TaskatCo app to manage daily tasks and help user to commit their dayliy task.
I used the latest Android technologies :
* Jetpack Compose and Material 3 for Ui
* Kotlin Coroutines
* Canvas
* Room Database
* MVVM approchead for clean architecture
* Alarm Manager to remind user on exact time
